#  You can use a minus sign to make a negative number like -2. What happens if you put a plus sign before a number? What about 2++2?
# solution:
# A plus sign before a number does not change its value. In the expression 2++2, 
the two plus signs next to each other are interpreted as a positive number followed by another positive number.
