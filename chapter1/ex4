# In math notation, leading zeros are okay, as in 02. What happens if you try this in Python?
# solution:
# Python allows integer literals in several computer number bases. The leading zero without any letter means octal, or base 8, and only has digits 0.. 7. 
If Python sees an 8 or 9 after a leading zero, then it complains about an invalid octal number.
