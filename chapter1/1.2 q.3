#  If you run a 10 kilometer race in 42 minutes 42 seconds, what is your average pace (time per mile in minutes and seconds)? What is your average speed in
   miles per hour?
# solution:
time_in_min=42+42/60
time_in_hours=time_in_min/60

distance_in_km=10
distance_in_miles=distance_in_km/1.61

avg_pace=time_in_min/distance_in_miles
avg_speed=distance_in_miles/time_in_hours

print(avg_pace)
print(avg_speed)
